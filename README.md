Job Scrapper scraps for jobs from job websites and return properly filtered results. Why? 

Go to your favorite jobs website, search for the phrase "Junior Software Developer". Scroll through the results. How accurate are they? Frustrating I know. However, this is not a bug, this is done on purpose. Amongst other things, to keep traffic on their website. But... 

Just like me, you don't have the time to scroll through irrelevant search results. So I came up with a solution for myself. It might save you time and frustration as well. 

Job Srapper scrap jobs from a jobs website. It uses the specificied words to look for exactly what I want and return just the exact results. Which then are used to do a post request to our endpoint and saved as latest jobs.
